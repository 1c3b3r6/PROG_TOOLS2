# PROG_TOOLS2
This repository contains the codes for the Programming Tools-2 Lab Assignments.
The files and directories are prefixed with their serial number(in order of 
actual appearence).

eg. 
1ASSIGN = Assignment \#1.
2p_assgn1.c = problem \#2 of Assignment \#1.

This has been done so that CLI users can easily navigate through the files.
